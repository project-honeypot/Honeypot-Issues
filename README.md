# Honeypot-Issues
Welcome friend! 

Project Honeypot is still in the development phase, and we are working with it day and night to make the user experience as nice as possible. Have you found any bugs in the product? Do you miss any features? Is it hard to use, or do you disagree with our design choice? We would very much appreciate if you could help us making the product better by letting us know about any issues you find by reporting them in this repository.
